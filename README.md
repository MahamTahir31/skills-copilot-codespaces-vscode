## Step 2: Seeing AI code suggestions in a Javascript file!

_Nice work! :tada: You created a Codespace using a devcontainer file that installed Copilot!_

GitHub Copilot provides suggestions for numerous languages and a wide variety of frameworks, but works especially well for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Go, C# and C++. The following samples are in JavaScript, but other languages will work similarly.

Let's try this out utilizing Javascript for Copilot.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add a Javascript file and start writing code

1. From inside the codespace in the VS Code explorer window, create a new file.

> **Note**:
> If you closed the Codespace from above, please open it back up or create a new Codespace.

2. Name the file `skills.js`
3. Verify your new file looks like:

4. In the `skills.js` file, type the following function header.

   ```
   function calculateNumbers(var1, var2)
   ```

   GitHub Copilot will automatically suggest an entire function body in grayed text. Below is an example of what you'll most likely see, but the exact suggestion may vary.

5. Press `Tab` to accept the suggestion.

### :keyboard: Activity: Push code to your repository from the codespace

1. Use the VS Code terminal to add the `skills.js` file to the repository:

   ```
   git add skills.js
   ```

2. Next from the VS Code terminal stage and commit the changes to the repository:

   ```
   git commit -m "Copilot first commit"
   ```

3. Finally from the VS Code terminal push to code to the repository:

   ```
   git push
   ```

**Wait about 60 seconds then refresh your repository landing page for the next step.**
